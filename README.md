# Stock-Analysis
The first project is about the stocks sentiment analysis with using python


I use Finviz to collect the financial news headlines

In order to perform sentiment analysis, we need to do some 'Scoring' for each headlines.
Here I use NLTK VADER library https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html




The second project is about creating the most suitable portfolio with using the Efficient Frontiner from Modern Portfolio Theory.


In this case, we need to understand the meaning of the 'Risk', which is the volatility of assets.

Since we have more then one stock in our portfolio, we need to think of how these stocks movement correlates with each other.

The beauty of diversification is that you can even get lower risk than a stock with the lowest risk in your portfolio, by optimising the allocation.
